              Long before music trucks, glittering costumes, and iconic stage
              crossings, Carnival in Trinidad and Tobago was shaped by a people
              determined to express their freedom. Its earliest roots trace back
              to the 18th century, when French planters held exclusive
              masquerade balls celebrations enslaved Africans were barred from
              attending. In response, they created their own rituals in the
              streets, using drums, chants, and masks to reclaim joy and
              humanity in the face of oppression.{" "}

            <p className="text-white text-base sm:text-lg lg:text-xl mt-6 lg:mt-10">
              With Emancipation, those street celebrations erupted into a
              powerful public declaration of liberty our liberty. From that
              moment on, Carnival became the heartbeat of a nation that refused
              to forget its origins. It evolved into a space where every creed
              and race could wine, chant, jump, and create together, in a shared
              rhythm.

              From calypso to steelpan, from the fierceness of Jab to the
              swagger of the Fancy Sailor, every character carries a chapter of
              resistance, memory, and cultural pride. And every Carnival, when
              the sun hits the road and the music rises, we reenact that story
              all over again.
